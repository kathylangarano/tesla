This is an [Astro](https://astro.build/) project bootstrapped with npm create astro@latest

## Install

The **recommended** way to install the latest version of Astro is by running the command below:

```bash
npm create astro@latest
```

You can also install Astro **manually** by running this command instead:

```bash
npm install --save-dev astro
```

## Getting Started

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Tools and libraries

We will be using tailwind as a toll for styling.

### Tailwind

Here you can find the documentation for Tailwind [https://tailwindcss.com/ ](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/tailwind/)
Basically you must search for a class that suits your needs. 
```bash
npx astro add tailwind
```
This way you don't need to create any CSS file and you put every class that represents CSS inline in the html tag
