## Features

- Stunning visual design.
- Responsive layout for all screen sizes.

- Information about Tesla's latest electric vehicles.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your system.
- Familiarity with web development tools and concepts.

## Tools and libraries

We will be using tailwind as a toll for styling.

### Tailwind

Here you can find the documentation for Tailwind [https://tailwindcss.com/ ](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/tailwind/)
Basically you must search for a class that suits your needs. 
```bash
npx astro add tailwind
```
This way you don't need to create any CSS file and you put every class that represents CSS inline in the html tag
